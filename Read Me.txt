For my senior capstone I chose to focus on improving design elements on the web to be more inclusive for 
people who are diagnosed with ADHD and Dyslexia. I had to start from the ground up to impliment all the 
changes that my research had insistent were important. With the unique nature of both ADHD and Dyslexia 
I didnt just want to have a select few options for color shifts, so I gave the user full control over 
the color of the text color, the line color, the background, and the font of the text itself. I also 
designed the site so that all changes would be saved locally so you can see the same changes on all pages 
of the site.

The structure of the page is split up into four main parts. The main page which features my own iconography,
the modal displaying the changing options, and a menu to navigate my page, a design page, a development page, 
and then an about me page. Each one is set to save any design changes locally and reuse them on each page.
Any changes will be saved even if you exit out of the page. All other icons were made using svg files which 
allows them to animate using css and also have their colors changed along with the rest of the page.
